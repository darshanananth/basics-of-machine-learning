**Data Processing and Business Model Creation**

This repository contains essential Jupyter Notebook models used for data processing and the development of business models. Each notebook serves a specific purpose, helping to analyze data, build predictive models, and derive insights for decision-making.

Contents:

1. Data Acquisition (`1_Data_acquisition.ipynb`): 
   - Techniques and methods for collecting and acquiring data from various sources.

2. Probability Distribution (`2_Prob_Distribution.ipynb`): 
   - Understanding and visualizing different probability distributions to model data characteristics.

3. Normal Distribution Q-Q Plot (`3_Normal_Dist_Q_Qplot.ipynb`): 
   - Visualization of data distribution through Quantile-Quantile plots to assess normality.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (`4_EDA.ipynb`): 
   - Comprehensive analysis of datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods.

5. Linear Regression for House Price Prediction (`5_Linear_Regression_House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`): 
   - Building a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features.

6. Logistic Regression for Diabetes Classification (`6_Logistic_Regression_Diabetes_Classification.ipynb`): 
   - Using logistic regression to classify whether a patient is diabetic based on health indicators.

7. K-Means & Hierarchical Clustering for Mall Customer Segmentation (`7_KMeans_&_Hierarchical_Clustering_Mall_Cus...ipynb`): 
   - Segmenting mall customers using clustering techniques to identify distinct customer groups.

8. Decision Tree & Random Forest for Churn Classification (`8_Decision_Tree&_Random_Forest_Churn_Cla...ipynb`): 
   - Implementing decision trees and random forests to predict customer churn.

9. Naive Bayes for Online Purchase Classification (`9_Naive_Bayes_Online_Purchase_Classification.ipynb`): 
   - Classifying online purchases using the Naive Bayes algorithm based on historical data.
